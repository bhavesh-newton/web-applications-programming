# JavaScript Lecture Plan: Introduction to JavaScript (1.5 hours)

## 1. Introduction and Pre-read Check (15 minutes)

- **Objective**: Introduce the class and ensure students understood the pre-read.
    - **Instructor Introduction**: Brief introduction about yourself and your approach to teaching JavaScript.
    - **Student Introductions**: Ask students to briefly introduce themselves (name, background, interest in JavaScript).
    - Pre-read Check: Ask a few students to share what they learned and clarify any confusion.

## 2. JavaScript Basics (50 minutes)

### **a) Interesting JavaScript Code Examples (15 minutes)**

- **Objective**: Spark curiosity and excitement about JavaScript.
- **Content**:
    - Demonstrate fun and interactive code snippets:
        - Example 1: A simple interactive alert box using `alert()`.
        - Example 2: A countdown timer or basic number guessing game.
    - **Activity**: Students discuss what these examples achieve and how they might be useful.

### **b) Printing in JavaScript (10 minutes)**

- **Objective**: Teach students how to output data using JavaScript.
- **Content**:
    - Introduction to `console.log()`.
    - Compare it to Python's `print()` function.
    - Example:

    ```javascript
    let name = "Alice";
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);  // Template literals
    console.log("Multiple", "arguments", "work", "too");
    ```

    - **Activity**: Students practice using `console.log()` in the browser console.

### **c) Variables in JavaScript (15 minutes)**

- **Objective**: Introduce variable declaration and data types.
- **Content**:
    - Overview of `var`, `let`, and `const`.
    - Example:

    ```javascript
    let age = 25;
    const name = "John";
    var isStudent = true; // Avoid using `var` in modern JavaScript
    ```

    - Compare with Pythonâ€™s approach to variable assignment.
    - Discuss the importance of `const` for immutability.
    - **Activity**: Students declare variables of different types and log them.

## 3. Practice Session: MCQs and Hands-On Coding (20 minutes)

### **a) Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) (5 minutes)**

- Reinforce key concepts:
    - Basics of `console.log()`.
    - Understanding `let`, `const`, and `var`.
    - Practical differences between Python and JavaScript.

### **b) Coding Challenge (15 minutes)**

- Students complete a simple coding task:
    - Declare variables for their name, age, and a boolean indicating if they are students.
    - Use `console.log()` to display a message using these variables.
    - **Stretch Goal**: Use a template literal to format the output.

## 4. Summary and Q&A (5 minutes)

- **Objective**: Consolidate learning and address questions.
    - Recap the key takeaways from the session in a concise manner.
    - Open the floor for questions.
