# JavaScript Asynchronous Programming - Pre-read

## ðŸŽ¯ What to Expect

In this lecture, we'll dive into one of JavaScript's most powerful features: asynchronous programming. You'll learn how to write code that can handle time-consuming operations without freezing your application. This is essential for building responsive web applications!

## ðŸ“š Required Background

Before the lecture, make sure you're comfortable with:

1. **JavaScript Basics**:
   - Functions and function calls
   - Objects and arrays
   - Basic error handling (try/catch)

2. **ES6+ Features**:
   - Arrow functions: `() => {}`
   - Template literals: `` `Hello ${name}` ``
   - Object destructuring: `const { data } = response`

## ðŸŒŸ Key Concepts to Know

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous

Think of it like ordering at a restaurant:

- **Synchronous**: Standing at the counter until your order is ready (blocking)
- **Asynchronous**: Taking a number and being notified when your order is ready (non-blocking)

### Promises

A Promise is like a receipt for an order:

- It represents a future value
- It can be either fulfilled (success) or rejected (failure)
- You can attach handlers to deal with the results

Example of a Promise you might have seen:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => console.log(response));
```

## ðŸ¤” Reflection Questions

Before the lecture, think about:

1. Why might we need asynchronous operations in web applications?
2. What happens when you run time-consuming operations in JavaScript?
3. Have you encountered any situations where your web app became unresponsive?

## ðŸŽ® Try This Out

Open your browser console and try this code:

```javascript
console.log('Starting');
setTimeout(() => console.log('This is async!'), 1000);
console.log('Ending');
```

What order do the messages appear in? Why?

## ðŸ“– Optional Pre-reading

If you want to get a head start:

- [MDN - Asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous) (First section only)
- [JavaScript.info - Callbacks](https://javascript.info/callbacks) (Introduction part)

## ðŸš€ Why This Matters

Asynchronous programming is crucial for:

- Building responsive user interfaces
- Handling API calls efficiently
- Managing database operations
- Processing large amounts of data
- Real-time features like chat applications

See you in the lecture where we'll master these concepts together! ðŸŽ“
