## Resources to Prepare

 1. Sample Webpage: A small HTML/CSS/JavaScript file for debugging activities.
 2. Buggy Script: Include a deliberate error for the Sources panel activity.
 3. Browser: Ensure all students have Chrome or Edge installed.

## Simple Scenarios

### 1. Changing the Text of an Element

- Scenario: You want to test different text for a heading without editing the HTML file.
- Steps:
  1. Open the `Elements` panel.
  2. Right-click on the heading (`<h1>`) and choose `Edit as HTML`.
  3. Change the text to something new.

```html
<h1>New Heading Text</h1>
```

### 2. Changing the Background Color of a Page

- Scenario: You want to see how a webpage would look with a different background color.
- Steps:

 1. Open the `Elements` panel.
 2. Select the <body> tag.
 3. In the Styles section, add the following CSS:

```css
body {
  background-color: pink;
}
```

### 3. Hiding an Element

- Scenario: Remove an element (e.g., a banner) temporarily to see how the page looks without it.
- Steps:

1. Open the `Elements` panel.
2. Right-click on the element and choose `Hide Element`.

```css
display: none;
```

### 4. Inspecting Fonts

- Scenario: Identify the font used in a specific section of a webpage.
- Steps:

1. Open the Elements panel and click on the element.
2. In the Styles tab, scroll to the font-family property.

```css
font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
```

### 5. Monitoring Console Logs

- Scenario: A webpage isn’t behaving as expected, and you want to see any error messages or logs.
- Steps:

1. Open the Console panel.
2. Look for console.log() messages, warnings, or errors.

```js
console.log("This is a debug message");
```

## Advanced Scenarios

### 6. Debugging a JavaScript Bug

- Scenario: A button click doesn’t perform the expected action.
- Steps:

1. Open the Sources panel and find the relevant JavaScript file.
2. Set a breakpoint in the button’s click event listener.
3. Click the button and step through the code line by line.

```js
document.getElementById("buggy-button").addEventListener("click", () => {
    // Deliberate typo: respone instead of response
    respone.textContent = "Button clicked!";
});
```

### 7. Analyzing Network Requests

- Scenario: An API call is taking too long or failing, and you want to see details.
- Steps:

1. Open the Network panel.
2. Reload the page and find the API request.
3. Inspect the Headers, Response, and Timing tabs.

### 8. Simulating Mobile Devices

- Scenario: Test how a webpage looks and behaves on a mobile device.

### 9. Monitoring Performance

- Scenario: A page is slow, and you want to find the bottleneck.
- Steps:

1. Open the Performance panel.
2. Start recording and interact with the page.
3. Stop recording and analyze the timeline to identify slow scripts or render-blocking resources.

### 10. Editing and Testing CSS Animations

- Scenario: Fine-tune the timing of a CSS animation without editing the CSS file directly.
- Steps:

1. Open the Animations tab in DevTools.
2. Play or pause animations and adjust durations or easing.

```css
@keyframes example {
    0% { transform: translateX(0); }
    100% { transform: translateX(100px); }
}
div {
    animation: example 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```
