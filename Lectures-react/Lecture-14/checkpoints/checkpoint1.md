## Coding Questions

1. Create a new React project using Create React App with the following requirements:
   - Project name should be "my-first-react-app"
   - Clean up the default App.js to show just a simple "Hello World"
   - Ensure the app runs without errors

2. Modify the default React application to:
   - Change the title in public/index.html
   - Remove unused files (logo, etc.)
   - Add a custom favicon

3. Practice Question:

   ```jsx
   // Fix the errors in this React component
   function App {
   return
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>Welcome to React</p>
   }
   ```

   Solution:

   ```jsx
   function App() { // missing function parameter paranthesis
      return ( // missing return statement paranthesis
         <div> // missing wrapping div
            <h1>Hello World</h1> 
            <p>Welcome to React</p> 
         </div>
