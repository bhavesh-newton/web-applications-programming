# Introduction to React

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Understand what React is and its role in modern web development
- Learn the basic building blocks of React applications
- Grasp the concept of components and JSX syntax
- Be prepared for hands-on React development

## 1. What is React?

### üåç Understanding the React Ecosystem

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. Created by Facebook (now Meta), it has become one of the most popular front-end development tools.

### Key Concepts

- **Component-Based**: Everything in React is a component
- **Declarative**: You describe what you want, React handles the DOM manipulation
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient updates through a virtual representation of the UI
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows in one direction, making apps predictable

### Real-World Usage

- Facebook
- Instagram
- Netflix
- Airbnb
- Many more Fortune 500 companies

## 2. Components: The Building Blocks

### üì¶ Understanding Components

Components are like LEGO blocks - small, reusable pieces that you can combine to build complex UIs.

#### Types of Components

1. **Functional Components** (Modern approach):

    ```jsx
    function Welcome() {
      return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
    }
    ```

2. **Class Components** (Legacy approach):

    ```jsx
    class Welcome extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
      }
    }
    ```

In our lectures, we will only be using functional components.

### Component Philosophy

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Reusability
- Composability
- Independence

## 3. JSX: JavaScript + XML

### üîÑ Understanding JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML but comes with the full power of JavaScript.

#### Key Differences from HTML

1. **Attributes use camelCase**:
   - HTML: `class`, `onclick`
   - JSX: `className`, `onClick`

2. **JavaScript in Markup**:

    ```jsx
    const name = 'John';
    const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
    ```

3. **Style Differences**:

    ```jsx
    // JSX style
    const style = { backgroundColor: 'blue' };
    const element = <div style={style}>Hello</div>;
    ```

## ü§î Reflection Questions

1. How do components in React differ from traditional web development approaches?
2. Why might companies choose React over other frameworks?
3. How does JSX make UI development more intuitive?
4. What advantages does the component-based architecture offer?
